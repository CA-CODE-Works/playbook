# Inventory

**IN PROGRESS: This section is in the early planning stages and is subject to change. Stay tuned for details. **

To effectively assess where best to streamline statewide-wide government software procurement and development, Code California has developed the California Government Software Inventory protocol. The intent of CGSI is to itemize available state government software for re-use and introduce a standardize schema that effectively documents this.

The CGSI, distinct from the code.ca.gov public inventory,** is not** a requirement for code.ca.gov participation, but recommended as part of a process to assess software development redundancies and adopt a collaborative, resource-focused approach to innovation and fiscal responsibility.

Once an agency has inventoried its software, the Code Coordinator will assist in ensuring projects are published to a public-facing open source code sharing platform that can then be cataloged on code.ca.gov.

## Criteria

Inclusion criteria for CGSI:

* Custom developed software (government/vendor)

## Template

Based on the code.json schema, used for code.ca.gov data management, Code California has created a template to assist with state government software inventory documentation:

* [California Government Software Inventory template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13SVQU5V7qCJA58eBeLC-g25yiFrStRRp6t6PqKWtnPw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Categorization

Code California is developing project categorization guidance to aid in the findability of relevant government software releases. This will also help in realizing opportunities to merge or eliminate redundant development efforts.
