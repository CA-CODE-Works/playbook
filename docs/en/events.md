# Events

Code California hosts and organizes in-person events that bring together community members to align, develop rapport, educate and collaborate in informal, open space environments.

Code California plans to support four types of events, held quarterly or more frequently depending on need:

* (Public) Open California Sessions for all Code California community members 

* (Internal) Code California Sessions for code.ca.gov contributors and participating agencies

* (Internal) Individual Agency Code California check-ins for participating agencies

* (Internal) Project-specific check-ins for participating agencies, vendors and relevant contributors
