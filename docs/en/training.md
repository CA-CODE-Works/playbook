# Training

Code California aims to facilitate  individual and agency-specific training programs and resources to help agencies onboard and implement the California Open Source Policy.

## Working

This year CDT and GovOps partnered with CivicActions to develop and deliver Open Source and Agile training to procurement, legal, and IT leaders in CDT and the Department of General Services. More than 20 leaders have been engaged in this training over the last few months and its content and questions are informing this strategy.

The curriculum is open source, the sessions were recorded, and we plan to iterate from this training to expand it to the Code California Community.
